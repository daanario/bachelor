# Bachelor Project:
## Exploring Multi-Agent Competition Dynamics: A Simulation Study on Reinforcement Learning and Collusion

The code that produces all the relevant figures for the paper can be found in $\texttt{main.ipynb}$. The files \texttt{threeplayers.py} and \texttt{twoplayers.py} are python modules that implement the sequential oligopoly games with two and three agents, respectively. \texttt{utility.py} is a module consisting of a loose collection of utilities used in certain computations such as the Edgeworth Cycle benchmarks. \texttt{runtime.ipynb} is used for the runtime analysis presented in the paper. 

To run the Jupyter Notebook ($\texttt{ipynb}$) files, you can use the Jupyter Notebook application from a distribution like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/).
